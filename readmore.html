<h2> Genre Network representation </h2>
<p>Movie genres were very scattered, and very detailed. Doing Machine Learning on more than 300 different genres would lead to overfitting, and this feature had to be reduced before being used. To do so, it was assumed that certain genres appeared very frequently together, and that it was possible to group genres into clusters. A network representation was made, linking two films when they appeared together in a movie. </p>
