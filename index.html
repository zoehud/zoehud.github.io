<h2> The bare minimum... right ? </h2>

<p>Cinema is an art reflecting society and therefore, lays bare its inequalities, particularly concerning the portrayal of women on screen. The Bechdel Test provides a simple criterion to assess this representation in films and works of fiction. It highlights the underrepresentation of women, often relegated to secondary roles or romantic interests when they do appear in movies. The test has three criteria that a film must meet to pass:
 it must have at least two named female characters, these characters must have a conversation with each other, and the conversation must be about something other than a man.
<br> Although this test seems like a bare minimum, less than half of noteworthy films from the past 40 years have passed.</p>

<h2> So which movies make the cut ? </h2>
<p>Using a merged version of the CMU Movie Corpus and the Bechdel Score dataset, we take a look at a variety of features to determine their impact on the movie's success in the test. <br> For more information about our datasets head over to our "Data" tab ! </p>
<p><strong> TIME </strong>
<br> The representation of minorities in media has only truly become a mainstream question in Western culture in the past century. Indeed, it was secondary to basic rights such as voting, financial independence, bodily autonomy, many of which were accorded to women only in the midst of the 20th century.
So it is rational to expect an increase in movies including women as equals to their male counterparts over the years. </p>
   {% include_relative _includes/plots/perc_pass_years.html %}
<p>Although we do not see a stark increase in the proportion of films that pass the test, the Spearman's rank correlation linking the year to the proportion of passes is statistically significant at the 0.5% confidence level.
<br> Visually, what we do observe is a stabilization of the proportion of films passing the Bechdel. In order to better visualize this we calculated and plotted the rolling standard deviation.</p>
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/std_pass.html %}
<p>Indeed, Spearman's coefficient for the standard deviation as related to the year is strongly negative and significant at the 0.01% level. Although this is likely linked to the increase in the quantity of movies over time, 
meaning our observations will always be more representative for later years, it also strongly implies that over time, the outlook on the representation of women has changed. 
The proportion of films passing the test became more stable, and experienced less variation, as female representation became less of a "fluke" or afterthought, and more of a persistent social discussion.
</p>
<p><strong> GENRE </strong>
<br> Of the top ten genres represented in our dataset, the genres with the highest proportions of films that pass the test are the three subsets of <i>romance</i>, <i>drama</i>, followed by <i>horror</i>. On the other hand, the worst offenders are movies classified as <i>action</i> and/or <i>adventure</i>.
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/genre_pass.html %}
</p>
<p>
<br> At first this is surprising, considering that romance films are largely centered around a heterosexual relationship, we could be inclined to believe that these movies would find it difficult to represent a conversation between two women about something other than a man.
   However, it is important to remember who these movies are marketed to : women. This is in level contrast to action movies, which are a stereotypically masculine interest.
<br> To complement this observation, we took a deeper look at some genres with varying target demographics. 
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/war_pass.html %}
<p>
   Almost twice as many movies associated with the <i>war</i> genre fail the test than pass. This can be linked to the fact that historically, women were not soldiers in many countries.
   However, in order to accurately depict a war, a movie cannot just be comprised of simple battle scenes. Women have always played their part in wars, as nurses on the field, or as labourers replacing the drafted men. On top of this, representing wars without representing the
   civilian impact is impossible. So, we consider that the historical gender inequality of armies is not a valid reason for war movies to so drastically neglect the representation of women.
</p>
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/lgbt_pass.html %}
<p>
   We observe a nearly opposite distribution for the <i>LGBT</i> genre. Intuitively, a genre that pushes for the representation of one minority, is likely to be sensitive to the under-representation of other marginalized groups, such as women in media.
   Also, as one moves away from the heteronormative, the criteria of women speaking about something other than a man is more accessible. 
</p>
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/anim_pass.html %}
<p>
   Finally, an interesting phenomenon is apparent in the case of <i>animation</i> movies. For this genre, there is almost a parity between the amount of movies that pass and fail the test. 
   Animation movies rather than being marketed towards a particular gender are created mainly for children. This indicates that at one's most impressionable stage of life, the media they consume is equally likely to represent women as established individuals
   as it is to present them as simply accessories to men's stories. 
</p>
<p><strong> PRODUCTION COMPANY </strong>
<br>One might expect a company to impose its standards of inclusivity on the films in the franchise. What's more, some companies claim to be more "ethical" than others, such as Focus Features, which produces mostly committed auteur films, like <i>Dark Waters</i> or <i>Green Book</i> . In the end, only the top 7 biggest companies have more than 100 movies present in the dataset, and it is thus difficult to draw conclusions on smaller ethically oriented companies. As the big film companies don't really specialize in one type of film, and none of them stand out from the others for their particularly feminist values, it's hard to see their influence. 
</p>
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/prodcomp_pass.html %}
<p>
  After completing a Mann-Whitney U Test on our data, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of films that pass the test for each company as an average over time are significantly different. 
  We are already inclined to dismiss the production company as a variable that adds value to future predictive models, but we further apply a Levene's test to explore the validity of the null hypothesis that the variance of the proportion of movies that pass the test for each company over the years is equal two by two between companies.
  The results of this test allow us to dismiss this hypothesis at the 0.05% level only between Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, implying that companies have followed similar time trends in the quantity of films they produce that pass the test.
  We further complement the analysis with a chi-squared test of independence, which once again does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05% confidence level. Through this extensive testing, we can conclude with relative certainty that the production company does influence the score of movies on the Bechdel test.
