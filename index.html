<h2> The bare minimum... right ? </h2>

<p>Cinema is an art reflecting society and therefore, lays bare its inequalities, particularly concerning the portrayal of women on screen. The Bechdel Test provides a simple criterion to assess this representation in films and works of fiction. It highlights the underrepresentation of women, often relegated to secondary roles or romantic interests when they do appear in movies. The test has three criteria that a film must meet to pass:
 it must have at least two named female characters, these characters must have a conversation with each other, and the conversation must be about something other than a man.
<br> Although this test seems like a bare minimum, less than half of noteworthy films from the past 40 years have passed.</p>

<h2> So which movies make the cut ? </h2>
<p>Using a merged version of the CMU Movie Corpus and the Bechdel Score dataset, we take a look at a variety of features to determine their impact on the movie's success in the test. <br> For more information about our datasets head over to our <a href="https://zoehud.github.io/data.html">Data tab </a> ! </p>
<p><strong> TIME </strong>
<br> The representation of minorities in media has only truly become a mainstream question in Western culture in the past century. Indeed, it was secondary to basic rights such as voting, financial independence, bodily autonomy, many of which were accorded to women only in the midst of the 20th century.
So it is rational to expect an increase in movies including women as equals to their male counterparts over the years. </p>
   {% include_relative _includes/plots/perc_pass_years.html %}
<p>Although we do not see a stark increase in the proportion of films that pass the test, the Spearman's rank correlation linking the year to the proportion of passes is statistically significant at the 0.5% confidence level.
<br> Visually, what we do observe is a stabilization of the proportion of films passing the Bechdel. In order to better visualize this we calculated and plotted the rolling standard deviation.</p>
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/std_pass.html %}
<p>Indeed, Spearman's coefficient for the standard deviation as related to the year is strongly negative and significant at the 0.01% level. Although this is likely linked to the increase in the quantity of movies over time, 
meaning our observations will always be more representative for later years, it also strongly implies that over time, the outlook on the representation of women has changed. 
The proportion of films passing the test became more stable, and experienced less variation, as female representation became less of a "fluke" or afterthought, and more of a persistent social discussion.
</p>
<p><strong> GENRE </strong>
<br> Of the top ten genres represented in our dataset, the genres with the highest proportions of films that pass the test are the three subsets of <i>romance</i>, <i>drama</i>, followed by <i>horror</i>. On the other hand, the worst offenders are movies classified as <i>action</i> and/or <i>adventure</i>.
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/genre_pass.html %}
</p>
<p>
<br> At first this is surprising, considering that romance films are largely centered around a heterosexual relationship, we could be inclined to believe that these movies would find it difficult to represent a conversation between two women about something other than a man.
   However, it is important to remember who these movies are marketed to : women. This is in level contrast to action movies, which are a stereotypically masculine interest.
<br> To complement this observation, we took a deeper look at some genres with varying target demographics. 
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/war_pass.html %}
<p>
   Almost twice as many movies associated with the <i>war</i> genre fail the test than pass. This can be linked to the fact that historically, women were not soldiers in many countries.
   However, in order to accurately depict a war, a movie cannot just be comprised of simple battle scenes. Women have always played their part in wars, as nurses on the field, or as labourers replacing the drafted men. On top of this, representing wars without representing the
   civilian impact is impossible. So, we consider that the historical gender inequality of armies is not a valid reason for war movies to so drastically neglect the representation of women.
</p>
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/lgbt_pass.html %}
<p>
   We observe a nearly opposite distribution for the <i>LGBT</i> genre. Intuitively, a genre that pushes for the representation of one minority, is likely to be sensitive to the under-representation of other marginalized groups, such as women in media.
   Also, as one moves away from the heteronormative, the criteria of women speaking about something other than a man is more accessible. 
</p>
    {% include_relative _includes/plots/anim_pass.html %}
<p>
   Finally, an interesting phenomenon is apparent in the case of <i>animation</i> movies. For this genre, there is almost a parity between the amount of movies that pass and fail the test. 
   Animation movies rather than being marketed towards a particular gender are created mainly for children. This indicates that at one's most impressionable stage of life, the media they consume is equally likely to represent women as established individuals
   as it is to present them as simply accessories to men's stories. 
</p>
<p><strong> PRODUCTION COMPANY </strong>
<br>One might expect a company to impose its standards of inclusivity on the films in the franchise. What's more, some companies claim to be more "ethical" than others, such as Focus Features, which produces mostly committed auteur films, like <i>Dark Waters</i> or <i>Green Book</i> . In the end, only the top 7 biggest companies have more than 100 movies present in the dataset, and it is thus difficult to draw conclusions on smaller ethically oriented companies. As the big film companies don't really specialize in one type of film, and none of them stand out from the others for their particularly feminist values, it's hard to see their influence. 
</p>
 {% include_relative _includes/plots/prodcomp_pass.html %}
<p>
  After completing a Mann-Whitney U Test on our data, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of films that pass the test for each company as an average over time are significantly different. 
  We are already inclined to dismiss the production company as a variable that adds value to future predictive models, but we further apply a Levene's test to explore the validity of the null hypothesis that the variance of the proportion of movies that pass the test for each company over the years is equal two by two between companies.
  The results of this test allow us to dismiss this hypothesis at the 0.05% level only between Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, implying that companies have followed similar time trends in the quantity of films they produce that pass the test.
  We further complement the analysis with a chi-squared test of independence, which once again does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05% confidence level. Through this extensive testing, we can conclude with relative certainty that the production company does influence the score of movies on the Bechdel test.
</p>
<p><strong> BOX OFFICE REVENUE </strong>
 <br> A film's success is often measured by the revenue it brings in at the box office, which reflects the quantity of people who went to the theatre to see the movie. 
  First we adjust the movies in the dataset's revenues for inflation using the CPI yearly for the US dollar, then calculate weighted proportions in order to adjust for the fact that much fewer films make very high amounts and most make between $0 to $100 million.
  This reveals a graphically negative relationship between revenue and a positive result on the Bechdel test. We confirm this visual interpretation with Spearman's coefficient test, which is statistically significant and strongly negative.
  
<br> {% include_relative _includes/plots/revenue_pass_infl.html %}
</p>
<p><strong> RUNTIME </strong>
<br> It could be expected that a longer film is more likely to contain dialogue between two women, and thus has more chance to pass the Bechdel test. In the end, the distributions are not significantly different (p-val of the TTest is 0.46), and Movie Runtime is discarded from the features of interest. 
By exploring this data, it was found that some films lasting over three hours don't even pass the Bechdel condition of having two named women ! We talk for example of <i>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> (3h20), <i>Dances with wolves</i> (3h56), <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> (4h11) or <i>Gettysburg</i> (4h31)...
{% include_relative _includes/plots/bxplt_time.html %}

<h2>What does the Bechdel test really measure ?</h2>
<p>If the Bechdel-Wallace test aims to highlight sexism in certain films, it is not a foolproof tool and does not allow us to determine whether a film is feminist or not, which was not Alison Bechdel's intention in creating this test. Indeed, this simplistic test overlooks issues of diversity among women, their representation, roles, and development in the storyline. For example, the film <i>Transformers</i> passes the Bechdel test thanks to a scene where the character Judy tells Sam's girlfriend that she is beautiful. In this often criticized as sexist and clichéd film, Megan Fox embodies the sexualized young American woman, an object of fantasy for male characters in the film, who needs to be saved by the main protagonist. The actress of the film denounced the sexist treatment she experienced, especially from Michael Bay. The film "Blue is the Warmest Color" is also a perfect example of the shortcomings of the Bechdel test in measuring a movie's respectful and accurate representation of women. This movie follows a young woman exploring her sexuality, and portrays a lesbian relationship. Unfortunately, the representation is horribly underwhelming, fetishizing the relationship between two women. The actresses even spoke out about their discomfort and mistreatment on set at the hands of the director.
On the other hand, the Bechdel test can also give a low score to films genuinely committed to feminism, like <i>Gravity</i>, where Sandra Bullock is the only female character in a cast of two (her and George Clooney), representing 50% of the cast. She portrays a strong female character, excelling in her technical field, and demonstrates great strength and physical resilience by surviving impacts that no man could survive. 
The test also fails to provide insights into the representation of the female gender within the film crew.

</p>

<p><strong> BEHIND THE CAMERA </strong>
<br> One of the most crucial factors in determining if a film is more likely to pass the Bechdel test than another is to look at the gender of the person behind the camera. When it's a female director or an all-female team, 84% of films pass the Bechdel test, whereas only 51% pass when directed by men. More than 12% of films directed by men don't pass any test at all!
</p>

{% include_relative _includes/plots/movies_directors.html %}

<p> Even worse, when there are no women in charge, meaning only male directors, well, it's straightforward 37% of films fail the test.


As the representation of women in films is heavily influenced by those behind the camera, their underrepresentation in directorial roles in the film industry has consequences (they comprise only 6.5% of directors and 11% of writers).



</p>

{% include_relative _includes/plots/gender_distribution_directors.html %}
{% include_relative _includes/plots/gender_distribution_writers.html %}
<p>Only 2% of directors are accounted for among the 100 highest-grossing films in our dataset. Last year, Jane Campion clinched the Best Director Oscar for steering the Western drama The Power of the Dog. She now joins the ranks of Kathryn Bigelow, who won for The Hurt Locker, and Chloé Zhao for Nomadland, making them the three female directors who have secured an Oscar. The first woman to receive this honor did so in 2010, 80 years after the ceremony's creation, and only eight female directors have been nominated in the Best Director category. Interestingly, out of these 8 films, only 5 pass the Bechdel test. All of this continues to reinforce what is known as the "male gaze," a concept indicating that the dominant visual culture is imbued with a male perspective.
</p>
<img src="/assets/images/writers_directors.png" alt="writer/director">
<p>This graph offers a visual representation of the changing weighted proportions of female directors and writers, as well as the proportion of movies passing the Bechdel test, across different decades. As seen in the previous figures, there is a clear correlation between the proportion of movies passing the Bechdel test and the proportions of female directors and writers.</p>

<h2> IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA </h2>
  
<img src="/assets/images/proportion_actresses.jpeg" alt="writer/director">

<h2> WHAT MOVIE CHARACTERISTICS CAUSE BECHDEL RESULTS? </h2>
<p>In order to improve the analysis, we perform a causal analysis. We are interested in knowing the actual impact of the proportion of actresses in a movie on whether a movie passes the Bechdel test or not. As this variable may be influenced by other variables, a causal analysis seems to be relevant. 
First of all, we separated the data set according to the proportion of actresses, that is one subpart with more than 50% of actresses and another subpart with less. Then, we balanced the subsets using the propensity scores (probability of a data point to be in either subset). We match each data point in one group with exactly one data point from the other group.
Now, we can compare the distribution of movies passing the Bechdel test in each group. As expected, a higher proportion of women seems to have a clear impact on this. Only half of the movies pass the test in the group where actresses are in a minority, while 80% of movies do when there is a majority of them.

</p>  

<h2> CAN WE PREDICT IF A MOVIE WILL PASS OR FAIL BECHDEL? </h2>
<p>Embarking on a data-driven exploration, we harnessed the power of machine learning to predict whether a film stands the Bechdel test. Armed with features like genres, release year, box office revenue, runtime, the count of female actresses, the proportion of female actresses, the age ratio among actors, and the film's originating countries, our model seeks to decipher the intricate landscape of female representation in cinema.
In our quest for accuracy, we didn't settle for one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we experimented with a diverse array of machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Random Forest, CatBoost, and Logistic Regression. Each algorithm brings its unique strengths and nuances to the table.
Neural Networks dive deep into complex relationships within the data. Random Forest, a versatile ensemble method, excels at handling diverse features and nonlinear patterns. CatBoost, designed for categorical data like genres and countries. Logistic Regression, a classic yet effective choice, offers simplicity in interpretation.
The beauty lies in the diversity of approaches – a fusion of computational prowess and cinematic intuition. Our exploration of these algorithms opens the door to understanding the nuances of female representation in films, bringing us one step closer to a more inclusive cinematic future. Join us on this journey as we decode the language of algorithms and unveil the untold stories behind the numbers.

<p>  Our project to predict if movies pass the Bechdel Test using machine learning ended up with an interesting result: each of our algorithms had about a 70% success rate. This tells us a couple of important things. First, while using data like the movie genre, how many women are in it, and how much money it made can help guess if a film passes the Bechdel Test, these numbers don't tell the whole story. There's more to understanding how women are shown in movies than just these facts.
Even though we used different methods like Neural Networks and Logistic Regression, none of them could perfectly figure out which movies passed the test. This shows us that the way women are represented in movies is complex and not just about data. It's also about the story, the conversations, and the director's choices, which are hard to measure with numbers.
In short, our work shows that while using computers and data is helpful, it's just one piece of the puzzle. To really understand how women are portrayed in movies, we need to look at the bigger picture, including the stories and contexts in the movies. This way, we can get a fuller understanding of women's roles in cinema.
